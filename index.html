                <h2>Short Description of the Capstone</h2>
                <p>
                    This capstone will serve to educate myself and others about wine culture in the Chianti region.
                    This will include using a few wines as examples as well as explaining the production of wines in the Chianti region.
                    This will expand upon wine knowledge acquired before coming to Florence Italy.<br><br>
