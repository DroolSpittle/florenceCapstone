    <h1>Reasons for Choosing Wine Culture While Abroad in Italy</h1>
    <h3>
        When deciding what my capstone was going to be while studying abroad I wanted to think about something that
        I had a personal interest in. <img class="myImage" src="chianti.jpg"> At first I was going to choose technology, but Italy is signifigantly behind
        when it comes to modern computing technology, at least in the area that I was in. <img class="computerImage" src="florence.jpg"> 
        Then I wanted to compare the cultures from the U.S and Florence.
        This led me to eventually choose my capstone to be about wine culture. Another factor that played into this is
        that I have had some wine training when I was working at Ruth's Chris. This oppurtunity would give me a chance to
        explore a culture in which wine plays a pivotal role in the surrounding culture and that also places a great
        importance on wine and the process surrounding it. <img class="wineImage" src="wine.jpg">

    <h2> About traveling</h2>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While abroad there were many experiences that I was able to take advantage of. From flying into London, to leaving the same way. The extra traveling is what I did for most of my weekends.
        Whether this was travling within Italy or to different places in Europe. <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in London the first time, we did not really have any plans and as such we mostly slept off any jet lag and rode around on bikes.
        We saw The national gallery in London and also explored as many streets as possible. This traveling with little to no planning would continue
        the whole time that we were abroad and is how I usually travel on my own. I feel that this leads to more experiences and allows for much more
        exploration than having a solid plan. While in London we also saw the football stadium. The only plans we had at this point was a day to take a train to Paris.
        We then finished our first three days there and we caught our train to Paris. This train was probably one of my favorite traveling experiences due to how smooth the ride was.<br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris was an insane experience full of beautiful sights and amazing art and architecture. While we took bikes most places in London, we decided to walk in Paris.
        Nothing prepares you for how large these European cities are and how diffferent each area is. When first arriving in Paris we were a bit worried as we had been told
        that the French were very rude to Americans. This turned out to be completely untrue and we only had an issue once with a Danish man. <br><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best part about traveling without plans is when you find something completely on accident. In our case it was the Louvre Museum. Which we thought was just the pyramid part and a small inside.
        We could not have been further from the truth, the museum was so large that we ended up going back another day to see the Mona Lisa and finish up the side that we had not seen.
        One interesting part of the Louvre, besides the amazing artwork that could be looked at for hours for each piece, was the way that they closed. They announced that the louvre
        was closing, and then they slowly walked towards the entrance from each side, accumulating more and more workers as they came. It looked like an army coming for you to force you out.
        After seeing the Louvre we decided that we wanted to see the Eiffel Tower and took at Tuk Tuk to get there. As it was still bright out we decided to wait until the sun was going down to go up the tower.
        This played to our advantage as the top was initially closed, but then happened to open later. We eventually bought our tickets and stood in line and then ascended the tower.
        While the Tower is not the tallest building in the world it is still an incredible view of Paris and all the different parts of it. We spent around 2 hours at the top and second floor getting plenty
        of pictures and just experiencing the view of the sunset.
